# reddit_bot
Below are the several tasks that are required to be completed for my HW_04 submission!

1. Clearly state which politican your bot is supporting or opposing.
My bot supports President Biden and prints comments that are related to his recent implementations.'

2. Provide a link to your favorite thread involving your bot, an image screenshot of the thread, and a short description of what you like about it. 
["Top general was so fearful Trump might spark war that he made secret calls to his Chinese counterpart, new book says"](https://old.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r489qu/top_general_was_so_fearful_trump_might_spark_war/) was my favorite thread. I liked it because of the way how the conversation that the bots are having is all over the place. Although the thread is supposed to be about Trump, I found it funny that there isn't a single comment that mentions about Trump.

4. Explain what your score should be.
